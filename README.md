# Introduction 

R build in dataset "mtcar" is used in this shiny app. 

Basically, it shows the relationship between the car's weight (1000 lbs) and its fuel consumption(Miles/gallon). 

Users can interact with the slide bar to change the car's weight. From 1 to 6 (1000 lbs). Accordingly, the fuel consumption level will also change.
